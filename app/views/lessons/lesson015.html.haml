%h1 Lesson 015 [ Rails Controller Intro. ]

%p This lesson is a standalone lesson.

%p That means we can ignore most of the previous lessons in order to get set up.

%p I did this lesson and I started by getting access to a copy of Ubuntu 16.04.

%p After I logged into Ubuntu, I created an account named rc10:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo rc10
      sudo passwd rc10
      ssh -AY rc10@localhost

%p Next, I installed some sofware using apt:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15a'

%p Then, I added some syntax to the end of ~rc10/.bashrc


.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15a2'


%p Next, I installed Ruby 2.6.0 in the rc10 account using rbenv:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15b'

%p Next, I installed Rails 5.2.2 in the rc10 account using the gem-shell-command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code gem install rails -v 5.2.2

%p Then, I used the rails-shell-command to create a new rails-app called rc10:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15c'

%p Next, I enhanced the Gemfile of the rc10 rails-app:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~rc10/rc10
      echo "gem 'haml'"       >> Gemfile
      echo "gem 'haml-rails'" >> Gemfile
      bundle
%p Also, I added a Procfile which will be used later:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code echo web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb > ~rc10/rc10/Procfile
    
%p Then, I started the web server using the rails-shell-command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~rc10/rc10
      rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 4010

%p At that point I was ready to start this lesson which is Lesson 015.

%p A Rails Controller can serve a wide variety of use-cases.

%p The simplest use-case is: "Create a Route".

%p I use an example to describe this use-case.

%p Suppose I deploy the rc10 rails-app to this domain: rc10dan.com

%p And imagine that I want this app to serve photos of cars.

%p When a user loads this URL: rc10dan.com/cars/ford

%p Then the user should see photos of Fords.

%p The above string: '/cars/ford' is a route.

%p Now that you know what a route is, I declare that a route can be created by creating a Rails Controller.

%p I am not forced to create a route by creating a Rails Controller.

%p I have other ways to create routes in Rails.

%p But, I can create a route by creating a Rails Controller.

%p And, the best way to create a route is by creating a Rails Controller.

%p The syntax below shows how I created some routes by creating a Rails Controller using the rails-shell-command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~rc10/rc10
      rails generate controller cars chevy dodge ford honda toyota vw

%p After I run the above shell command, my rc10 rails-app will have these routes ready for action:

%ul
  %li /cars/chevy
  %li /cars/dodge
  %li /cars/ford
  %li /cars/honda
  %li /cars/toyota
  %li /cars/vw

%p If I visit any of the above routes with a browser, Rails will show me a page.

%p For example when I visit /cars/ford I see this:

%img(src='/lesson015/ford.png')
%hr/

%p If I visit this route: /cars/nissan, Rails will serve me a routing-error because I did not list 'nissan' when I generated the cars-controller.

%p Rails, however, tries to be helpful by showing me, the developer, which routes are available:

%img(src='/lesson015/nissan.png')
%hr/

%p Next, I created a route to what I call the "Home Page":

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~rc10/rc10
      rails generate controller home index

%p Then, I used Emacs to make ~rc10/rc10/app/views/home/index.html.haml
%p look like this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15d'


%p Then, I used Emacs to make ~rc10/rc10/config/routes.rb
%p look like this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15e'

%p Then, I used google to search for photos of Chevys:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=Chevy+cars' target='x')
    https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=Chevy+cars

%p I copied some of the photos to this folder: ~rc10/rc10/public/

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~rc10/rc10/public/
      wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/1971_Chevrolet_Vega_Coupe.jpg
      wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Flickr_-_DVS1mn_-_47_Chevrolet_Stylemaster.jpg
      wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/1968ChevroletCamaroZ28.png

%p Then, I used Emacs to make ~rc10/rc10/app/views/cars/chevy.html.haml
%p look like this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15f'
%p Next, with my browser I visited the "/" path:

%img(src='/lesson015/slash.png')
%hr/

%p Then, I clicked on the Chevy link which sent me to this path: "/cars/chevy"

%p And, I saw this:

%img(src='/lesson015/cars_chevy.png')
%hr/

%p Next, remembering lesson013, I installed the Heroku Bash command:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson15heroku1'

%p Then, I logged into Heroku using a Bash command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~rc10/rc10
      heroku auth:login

%p Next, I committed to git:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      git config --global user.email "rc10dan77@facebook.com"
      git config --global user.name "Bob Smith"
      git add .
      git commit -am hello
      git push heroku master

%p Then, I loaded the new Heroku App in my browser:

%img(src='/lesson015/hero_chevy.png')
%hr/

%p I was happy to see that page so I considered this to be a good place to end lesson015.
