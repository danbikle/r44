%h2 Elements, Tags, and Attributes

%p Before we learn more Rails, we need to learn some HTML.

%p If you know HTML you might skip this lesson.

%p HTML is a language written by people and interpreted by browsers.

%p To start, you use Emacs to write HTML syntax into a file.
%p Then a webserver serves that file to a browser when the browser asks for it.

%p Next, the browser transforms the HTML into text, images, sound, and video.

%p I list some example HTML below:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code &lt;h1>hello&lt;/h1>

%p The example above is an h1-element which has three pieces:
%ul
  %li Opening tag: &lt;h1>
  %li Text: hello
  %li Closing tag: &lt;/h1>

%p After the above element passes through a browser, you should see the element as this:
%hr/
%h1 hello
%hr/


%p Often developers will nest elements.

%p For example you might see a td-element nested inside a tr-element which is nested inside a table-element:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson009a'

%p The above syntax might be rendered as this:
%hr/
%table(border='1')
  %tr
    %td Calif
    %td NY
  %tr
    %td Tex
    %td Wash
%hr/

%p When I study the above table-element, I notice an expression inside the opening table-tag:

%p border='1'

%p That expression is an example of an HTML object called an "attribute".

%p Another example of an attribute is displayed below inside an a-element (sometimes called an "anchor-element"):

.syntax
  %pre
    %code &lt;a href='https://www.google.com'> click here for Google &lt;/a>
    
%p The above attribute is called an "href attribute".

%p The above element is rendered below:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.google.com')
    click here for Google

%p Attributes follow some simple rules.
%p They have a word, an equal sign, and then a string.

%p If I want, I may put multiple attributes in a tag:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code &lt;a href='https://www.cnn.com' target='c' class='newslink'> click here for CNN &lt;/a>
    
%p The above element is rendered below:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.cnn.com' target='c' class='newslink')
    click here for CNN

%p Sometimes students ask, "May I put an attribute in a closing tag?"
%p Answer: No.

%p For now, that is most of what you need to know about elements, tags, and attributes.

%p Here is a summary:

%ul
  %li HTML is made from elements.
  %li Elements are made from opening tags and closing tags.
  %li I can place plain text inside an element (between the tags).
  %li I can nest an element inside an element (which is very common).
  %li An attribute is made from a word, an equal sign, and then a string.
  %li I can place 0 or more attributes in any opening tag.

%h2 Common HTML Elements

%p After you undestand a bit about Elements, Tags, and Attributes you should memorize some frequent patterns in HTML pages.

%p Here is a skeleton of an HTML page which many developers use:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson009b'

%p Here is a link to the above page:

%a(href='/tofu.html') tofu.html

%p The page, tofu.html, is simple.
%p A typical page I write will use more elements.
%p Common Elements I use in my HTML pages are listed below:

%ul
  %li html
  %li head
  %li title
  %li meta
  %li link
  %li body
  %li h1, h2, h3
  %li a
  %li div
  %li p
  %li ul
  %li li
  %li hr
  %li br
  %li img
  %li pre
  %li code
  %li table
  %li th
  %li tr
  %li td
  %li script
  %li style

%p HTML has been used since 1990.

%p It is easy to get information on how to use any of the above elements.

%p For example:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?q=In+HTML+what+does+the+ul-element+do' target='x')
    https://www.google.com/search?q=In+HTML+what+does+the+ul-element+do?

%h2 Put HTML files in public folder

%p In Lesson007 we created a new rails app with this shell command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code rails new db100

%p If you have done that, you should have a folder named db100 in your home folder.

%p If you have no db100 folder in your home folder, you should create one now:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~
      rails new db100

%p Now, you can use the Bash command below to copy tofu.html into the public folder of db100:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code curl -L rails4.us/tofu.html > ~/db100/public/tofu.html
    
%p At the end of lesson008 you should have started the Rails webserver.

%p If the webserver is down, you can restart it:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      cd ~/db100/
      bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 33000

%p When that server is up, you can see tofu.html in your browser.

%p Type this URL into your browser:
%p localhost:33000/tofu.html

%p I did that on my laptop and saw this:

%img(src='/lesson009/tofu1.png')
