%p To do this lesson, you should login to the account you created in lesson002.

%p I did this lesson and I can tell you it is short but important.

%p In Lesson 015, I showed a series of steps to create a new Linux account.

%p This lesson discusses those steps and gets you more comfortable with creating new Linux accounts.

%p I started by logging into Ubuntu, and then I installed some software:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt upgrade
      sudo apt install openssh-server

%p Often the above update and upgrade commands will fail.

%p If so, just run this command:
.syntax
  %pre
    %code sudo apt install openssh-server

%p Be aware that you can apt-install a package more than once and no harm should result.

%p This behavior is useful when you forget that you had already installed a package.

%p Anyway, return your attention back to update-upgrade failure.

%p Usually you can work around update-upgrade failure two ways:

%ul
  %li Wait 30 minutes for Ubuntu to prepare itself for update and upgrade
  %li Or, just ignore the failure (which is acceptable in a training environment)

%p The above software, openssh-server, will allow me to connect to my host with ssh.

%p If you are new to ssh, know that you can use ssh to login to another host from your shell.

%p This is useful if the host is in the cloud and rented to you by a company like  Amazon.

%p Also, this is useful if the host is the laptop in front of you.

%p Why?

%p I can use ssh to run a shell in another account on my current host.

%p Why do I want multiple accounts on my Linux laptop?

%p I see an account as a container of software.

%p After I place software in an account, the account offers some protection from software in other accounts.

%p How can software harm software?

%p Software is designed to be shared.

%p For example I can create two Rails apps: app1 and app2 using one copy of Rails 5.2.2.

%p Eventually I decide to upgrade Rails to 5.2.3.

%p Due to the upgrade, maybe app1 gets a certain set of bugs and app2 gets another set of bugs.

%p And maybe I can fix the app1-bugs.

%p Then, I will want to run app1 on Rails 5.2.3 and run app2 on 5.2.2.

%p I see then that I need to be careful how I share software.

%p I have developed the habit of avoiding the sharing of software between applications.

%p I want each application to have its own copy of software.

%p I have three good ways to isolate an application with its software:

%ul
  %li Place the application inside its own host (very strong isolation)
  %li Place the application inside its own account (strong isolation)
  %li Rely on software isolation features inside the language:
  %li
    %ul
      %li rbenv for Ruby
      %li Bundler for Ruby
      %li Virtualenv for Python
      %li conda env for Anaconda Python


%p Option one above is the most work.
%p Option two above is my preference.
%p Option three is problematic if I build an application from several languages.
